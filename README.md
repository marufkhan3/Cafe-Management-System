It is my first Database Management System Project 

Project Title: Cafe Management System

Objective: The Cafe Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the operations of a cafe. It allows both customers and the admin to interact with the system for managing orders, tracking sales, and handling customer data. The system enables smooth order management, billing, and sales tracking while offering an intuitive interface for cafe management.

The system is divided into two main roles: Admin and Customer.

Admin Panel: Provides the cafe staff with access to manage orders, view reports, and analyze performance metrics. The admin has the authority to add, edit, or delete menu items, track sales, and manage customer orders.

Customer Panel: Allows customers to view the menu, place orders, reserve tables, and track their order history. It ensures a seamless experience for customers to browse the cafe’s offerings and make purchases online.

Key Features:
